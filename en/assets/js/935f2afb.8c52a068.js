Multiple interceptors can work on a single route, launching one after another. Interceptors are analogous to middleware in ExpressJS, but interceptors can use DI. Additionally, interceptors can work before and after the controller\'s operation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components-of-ditsmod-app/log-mediator":{"id":"components-of-ditsmod-app/log-mediator","title":"LogMediator","description":"In Ditsmod, you can substitute the default logger with your own logger, and this will allow you to record in your own way even those messages that are issued in @ditsmod/core. But changing the logger does not allow you to change the text of the messages themselves and the level of logging (trace, debug, info, warn, error). LogMediator (or its child class SystemLogMediator) is used for this. Of course, if you have direct access to the code where the logger writes a certain message, then you can change this message on the spot without LogMediator. And if the message is issued by the Ditsmod framework itself or its modules, LogMediator is essential.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components-of-ditsmod-app/module":{"id":"components-of-ditsmod-app/module","title":"Modules","description":"Ditsmod module","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guides/conventions":{"id":"developer-guides/conventions","title":"\u0414\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u043f\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0434\u0443","description":"\u0422\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u0443 \u0432\u0438\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434\u0456 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0438 \\"\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430 \u0444\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0443\\" - \\"\u0456\u043c\'\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0443\\":","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guides/exports-and-imports":{"id":"developer-guides/exports-and-imports","title":"\u0415\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442, \u0456\u043c\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0440\u0456\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f","description":"\u0415\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0432 \u0437 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043b\u044f","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guides/providers-collisions":{"id":"developer-guides/providers-collisions","title":"Collision of providers","description":"Imagine you have Module3 where you imported Module2 and Module1.
