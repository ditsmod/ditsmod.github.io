Multiple interceptors can work on a single route, launching one after another. Interceptors are analogous to middleware in ExpressJS, but interceptors can use DI. Additionally, interceptors can work before and after the controller\'s operation.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components-of-ditsmod-app/log-mediator":{"id":"components-of-ditsmod-app/log-mediator","title":"LogMediator","description":"In Ditsmod application, you can substitute the default logger with your own logger, and this will allow you to record in your own way even those messages that are issued in @ditsmod/core. But changing the logger does not allow you to change the text of the messages themselves and the level of logging (trace, debug, info, warn, error). LogMediator (or its child class SystemLogMediator) is used for this. Of course, if you have direct access to the code where the logger writes a certain message, then you can change this message on the spot without LogMediator. And if the message is issued by the Ditsmod framework itself or its modules, LogMediator is essential.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components-of-ditsmod-app/logger":{"id":"components-of-ditsmod-app/logger","title":"Logger","description":"The logging level can be set by passing a provider with the LoggerConfig token:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components-of-ditsmod-app/module":{"id":"components-of-ditsmod-app/module","title":"Modules","description":"One of the main elements of the Ditsmod architecture are its modules. But what exactly is good about modular architecture? - Modularity allows you to compose different autonomous elements and assemble them into a scalable application. Thanks to the autonomy of the modules, large projects are easier to develop, test, deploy and maintain.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components-of-ditsmod-app/module-manager":{"id":"components-of-ditsmod-app/module-manager","title":"ModuleManager","description":"Metadata that you add to module decorators can be called \\"raw\\" metadata. The first stage of its processing takes place in the ModuleManager service. This service recursively scans all modules, starting from the root module, then normalizes and checks for correctness. ModuleManager has methods to find the metadata of specific modules, as well as methods for adding or removing module imports in the normalized representation (i.e. the raw metadata is not changed).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"components-of-ditsmod-app/providers-helper":{"id":"components-of-ditsmod-app/providers-helper","title":"Providers helper","description":"This class simplifies the addition of providers to DI while simultaneously controlling their types.

You did this import because you need Service2 and Service1 from these modules, respectively. You are viewing how these services work, but for some reason Service1 does not work as expected. You start debugging and it turns out that Service1 is exported from both modules: Module2 and Module1. You expected that Service1 would only be exported from Module1, but the version exported from Module2 actually worked.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guides/testing":{"id":"developer-guides/testing","title":"Testing","description":"What is unit testing","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Introduction","description":"About the project","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"native-modules/body-parser":{"id":"native-modules/body-parser","title":"@ditsmod/body-parser","description":"In this module, integration is done with @ts-stack/body-parser (which is a fork of the well-known ExpressJS package) and @ts-stack/multer (which is also a fork of the well-known ExpressJS package).

The @ditsmod/i18n module provides basic functionality for translating system messages (issued by the Ditsmod application at runtime) and provides the ability to easily extend dictionaries. In fact, you use ordinary services as dictionaries for translation, so the text for translation can be taken both from TypeScript files and from databases. The @ditsmod/i18n work is designed so that each current module can have its own translation, and that the translation of any imported module can be modified or supplemented.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"native-modules/jwt":{"id":"native-modules/jwt","title":"@ditsmod/jwt","description":"The @ditsmod/jwt module integrates jsonwebtoken into a Ditsmod authentication application based on JSON Web Token.
