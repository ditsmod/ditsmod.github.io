Ditsmod application, you can substitute the default logger with your own logger, and this will allow you to record in your own way even those messages that are issued in @ditsmod/core. But changing the logger does not allow you to change the text of the messages themselves and the level of logging (trace, debug, info, warn, error). LogMediator (or its child class SystemLogMediator) is used for this. Of course, if you have direct access to the code where the logger writes a certain message, then you can change this message on the spot without LogMediator. And if the message is issued by the Ditsmod framework itself or its modules, LogMediator is essential.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"basic-components/logger":{"id":"basic-components/logger","title":"Logger","description":"The logging level can be set by passing a provider with the LoggerConfig token:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"basic-components/modules":{"id":"basic-components/modules","title":"Modules","description":"One of the key elements of the Ditsmod architecture is its modules. But what exactly makes a modular architecture so advantageous? \u2014 Modularity allows you to compose various autonomous elements and assemble a scalable application from them. Thanks to the autonomy of modules, large projects are easier to develop, test, deploy, and maintain. Modularity also simplifies the transition to a microservices architecture if, in the future, you decide that your Ditsmod application requires horizontal scaling.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"basic-components/providers-helper":{"id":"basic-components/providers-helper","title":"Providers helper","description":"This class simplifies the addition of providers to DI while simultaneously controlling their types. Since this class implements the so-called Iteration protocols, it facilitates the conversion of itself into an array (note the spread operator):","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"deep-dive/application-workflow":{"id":"deep-dive/application-workflow","title":"Application workflow","description":"As stated in the application class overview, Ditsmod provides an API for writing applications with different architectural styles (REST, tRPC, GraphQL, WebSockets, Microservices, etc.). Initialization starts with creating an instance of the application class, and it is at this stage that the configuration accepted by the application class and the order of its assembly are determined.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"deep-dive/init-decorators":{"id":"deep-dive/init-decorators","title":"Init Decorators and Init Hooks","description":"If you can easily pass metadata to a module using a module with parameters, then creating an init decorator is not recommended. That is, whenever you want to create an init decorator, first consider using a module with parameters.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"deep-dive/module-manager":{"id":"deep-dive/module-manager","title":"ModuleManager","description":"Metadata that you add to module decorators can be called \\"raw\\" metadata. The first stage of its processing takes place in the ModuleManager service. This service recursively scans all modules, starting from the root module, then normalizes and checks for correctness. ModuleManager has methods to find the metadata of specific modules, as well as methods for adding or removing module imports in the normalized representation (i.e. the raw metadata is not changed).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guide/conventions":{"id":"guide/conventions","title":"Ditsmod coding style guide","description":"Here is the recommended format in the form of a pair \\"file name\\" - \\"class name\\":","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guide/testing":{"id":"guide/testing","title":"Testing","description":"What is unit testing","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"What is Ditsmod","description":"Introduction to Ditsmod","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"rest-application/controllers-and-services":{"id":"rest-application/controllers-and-services","title":"Router, controllers and services","description":"What does a REST router do?","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"rest-application/guards":{"id":"rest-application/guards","title":"Guards","description":"If you want to restrict access to certain routes, you can use guards.

The @ditsmod/i18n module provides basic functionality for translating system messages (issued by the Ditsmod application at runtime) and provides the ability to easily extend dictionaries. In fact, you use ordinary services as dictionaries for translation, so the text for translation can be taken both from TypeScript files and from databases. The @ditsmod/i18n work is designed so that each current module can have its own translation, and that the translation of any imported module can be modified or supplemented.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"rest-application/native-modules/jwt":{"id":"rest-application/native-modules/jwt","title":"@ditsmod/jwt","description":"The @ditsmod/jwt module integrates jsonwebtoken into a Ditsmod authentication application based on JSON Web Token.
